Wraps D3DX10CompileFromFile to replace fxc.

fxc sometimes generates bad or incompatible code for 
the actual D3D runtime.  This project uses the D3D(X)
runtime to replace fxc functionality to get around that.
This is currently very minimal, incomplete, and not well 
tested, but atleast it's a start that should be easy to 
build on as needed.

Premake4 is used to generate the visual studio files.
