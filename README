Wraps D3DX10CompileFromFile to replace fxc.

fxc sometimes generates bad or incompatible code for 
the actual D3D runtime.  This project uses the D3D(X)
runtime compiler to replace fxc functionality to get around that.
This is currently very minimal, incomplete, and not well 
tested, but atleast it's a start that should be easy to 
build on as needed.

This also replaces funky characters (above 127 in ascii) with
spaces.  This was basically just a workaround for bad characters 
that seemed to be added by, I think, cygwin.  In any case, 
it can't hurt, since the compiler chokes on invalid chars anyways.

Premake4 is used to generate the visual studio files.
